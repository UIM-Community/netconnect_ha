# netconnect_ha
CA UIM Net_connect High availability

This probe has been created to do netconnect ha (switch of all profiles when a HA occur on some hubs). This probe has not been created to be HA supported (so this is a unique probe).

> This probe is an alpha, she has been tested only in one pre-production context.

Feel free to contribute if you want to update / upgrade the probe 

# Roadmap 

- Better implementation of perluim framework (reduce useless code) 
- Better storage_ha (maybe with JSON.pm) and add a remote possibility for this file (idea for HA Support)
